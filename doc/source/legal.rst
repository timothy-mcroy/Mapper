The Mapper algorithm was invented by Gurjeet Singh, Facundo Mémoli and Gunnar Carlsson. It is presented in the paper [R1]_.

The point clouds in the ``exampleshapes`` directory were converted from mesh data which was published by Robert W. Sumner and Jovan Popović [R8]_. The mesh data was originally published along with the paper [R7]_.
